/**
  A local storage whose storage dir is located under '.git/.tortilla'.
  Mostly comes in handy when we want to share data between processes.
  If no '.git' dir was found, an in memory storage will be used instead.

  Used storage variables are listed below:

  - INIT - A flag used to determine whether Tortilla is initialized or not.
  - USE_STRICT - Tortilla's strict mode flag. If set, Tortilla will run certain
    validations before committing changes or rebasing them.
  - REBASE_HOOKS_DISABLED - This flag used to determine whether a step is currently
    being rebased or not, so Tortilla will know if it should overlook certain
    git hooks.
  - REBASE_OLD_STEP - Used by the editor to set the old step before rebasing.
  - REBASE_NEW_STEP - Will be set any time we run a step operation and is used by the
    editor so it can rebase our changes correctly.
  - HOOK_STEP - Forcibly set the step number which should be used by Tortilla's
    git hooks.
  - POTENTIAL_RELEASE - Used by the renderer so it will be aware of the release
    which have just been bumped.
  - STEP_MAP - A map of old steps and their new indexes which is being built during the
    step editing process in order to be able to update the diffStep template helpers in
    the manuals being rebased later on.
